# NativeScript Theme Builder

A quick and easy way to generate [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) CSS themes for your next cross-platform native mobile app.

Just want to use it? Go to [nativescriptthemebuilder.com](http://nativescriptthemebuilder.com) (it's free).

## How Does it Work?

Use the visual tools to tweak colors, borders, and fonts. Once you are happy, click the "Download Theme" button to download the CSS file for your NativeScript app. Styles will be applied globally to both iOS and Android (except where noted).

As of v2.4, NativeScript ships with a gorgeous default theme. This theme builder builds off of this default theme. Therefore, you *will need* to apply this CSS file *after* you use one of the default themes. Specific instructions are provided when you download the theme.

## Native Mobile App + CSS?

NativeScript uses a subset of CSS to style apps. Yes, the same CSS you've been using for web development. You can apply CSS to individual elements by id, classes, and types. Read more about [styling with NativeScript here](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling).

## Shout Outs

- [Ionic's CSS components](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/) made it possible to accurately simulate UI elements.
- Special thanks to the (now defunct) [Ionic Theme Editor](https://github.com/pbernasconi/ionic-theme-editor) for site design inspiration.
